  "bamLibsDescription": "Comma separated list of libraries in same order as BAM files. Assign each read the library corresponding to its file. By default, each read must have an RG tag and and the library is determined from the LB field. NOTE: This option is required when --bam-samps has been specified. Why? Your BAM file RG tags don't have an LB tag and you want to use a different tag instead (e.g. SM)",
  "libFieldDescription": "Read group field used to assign each read a library. By default, the library is determined from the LB field associated with RG. Why? Your BAM file RG tags don't have an LB tag and you want to use a different tag instead (e.g. SM)",
  "snpVcfDescription": "Bgzipped input VCF file containing phased SNP genotypes for the samples to be genotyped. These SNPs will be used to physically phase STRs. Why? You have available phased SNP genotypes"
